# split91 keyboard - Split Keyboard with right-hand B
![IMG_1773](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48749902/211684901-b1a25db1-95a3-4478-ae7c-319cf5f1e81f.JPG)

This keyboard is based on [split89](https://github.com/jurassic73/split89)

I wanted a keyboard that is familiar with 87% array usage, requires a direction key, and has a Function key.
Most split keyboards have a unique arrangement that requires time to adapt.

By chance, I found [split89](https://github.com/jurassic73/split89) on github, and I added B key to right-hand by modifying the stl files.
Thanks to [Jurassic73](https://github.com/jurassic73) for sharing a good keyboard and I would like to share my revised stl files and hex file here.

[QMK Official Documentation](https://docs.qmk.fm/#/) - You can solve any problems that arise during compile of qmk firmware.  
[Vial](https://get.vial.today/) - open-source cross-platform (Windows, Linux and Mac) GUI and a QMK fork for configuring your keyboard in real time.

**Modifications**
1. Add B key to right-hand
2. Add Rotary-encoder under right B key (This is just an option. You can use a mechanical keyboard switch, not rotary encoder)
3. Compiled Vial firmware for split91 keyboard

# Assembly  
It is recommended to refer to [split89](https://github.com/jurassic73/split89) for the overall build guide. It is written in great detail.  
I will only fill out the changed parts according to the addition of the switch.  

## left body
![left body](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48749902/211587024-b4f52067-8dcd-4dfe-8664-59f81b215e6f.png)  
left body is as same as split89  

## right body
![wire](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48749902/211585977-b1074450-3e16-47ba-966f-0aad6541c5dd.png)  
Row and column connection of the right body is shown in the picture above.  
This is a wirring that matches the keymap I uploaded. If you plan to compile qmk firmware yourself, you can change wirring.  
Ignore the blue line and look at the red line.  

## Attaching Left, Right Base and Left, Right Body
split89 used an M3 screw for assembling the top and bottom plates.  
However, split91 uses a magnet to attach the top and bottom plates.  
The left body is small in size, so the top and bottom plates are well attached.  
On the other hand, the output of right body has shrinkage. I think it's because the thickness is thin and the length is long.  
It is a disadvantage that may occur while using a magnet, so you may need to use a screw or an adhesive if you want.  

### Rotary Encoder
Two additional pins are required to soldering rotary encoder.
Here's the way. [Making two more pins available](https://golem.hu/guide/pro-micro-upgrade/)

## Keyboard Layout

## Controller Programming
Using [QMK Toolbox](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_toolbox/releases) for flashing [hex file](https://github.com/MinHyeong-Lee/split91/blob/main/split91_vial.hex)  
Both left body and right body should be flashed.  
You can connect usb anywhere on the left or right when you actually use it.  

After flashing, you can use Vial for your keyboard

![firmware size](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48749902/211693950-6167cc00-e878-4087-8f44-0275e5448699.png)

Vial is convenient but has a large firmware size.
I tried to reduce the size of the firmware, but I can use only 3 layers.  
You will be able to increase the number of the layer by compiling yourself except for features that you do not use among Mouse Key and Tab dance, Combo, and Media.  

If you want to compile firmware, clone [vial-qmk](https://github.com/vial-kb/vial-qmk) and move this repo into vial-qmk/keyboards/  

    cd ~/
    git clone https://github.com/MinHyeong-Lee/split91.git
    git clone https://github.com/vial-kb/vial-qmk.git
    mv -r split91 ~/vial-qmk/keyboards/
    cd vial-qmk
    qmk compile -j 8 -kb split91 -km vial
