# split91 keyboard - Split Keyboard with right-hand B

This keyboard is based on [split89](https://github.com/jurassic73/split89)

I wanted a keyboard that is familiar with 87% array usage, requires a direction key, and has a Function key.
Most split keyboards have a unique arrangement that requires time to adapt.

By chance, I found [split89](https://github.com/jurassic73/split89) on github, and I added B key to right-hand by modifying the stl files.
Thanks to [Jurassic73](https://github.com/jurassic73) for sharing a good keyboard and I would like to share my revised stl files and hex file here.

**Modifications**
1. Add B key to right-hand
2. Add Rotary-encoder under right B key (This is just an option. You can use a mechanical keyboard switch, not rotary encoder)
3. Compiled Vial firmware for split91 keyboard
